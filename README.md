Auth Lifecycle
A streamlined authentication lifecycle implementation for modern web apps. Handles user signup, login, token management, session handling, and secure logout — all optimized for smooth UX and robust security.

Features
User Registration with validation

Login / Logout flows with JWT or session tokens

Token Refresh for seamless session management

Password Reset via email (optional)

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) (if applicable)

Secure storage of tokens (HTTP-only cookies/localStorage)

Error handling and user-friendly feedback

Current Status
Note: Currently, authentication works only for the email tanvirxng09@gmail.com.
Support for multiple users will be enabled once the domain and full user management are set up.

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js / Express

Database: MongoDB 

Authentication: JWT / OAuth / Passport.js 

Frontend: React / Tailwindcss

How It Works
Signup: User submits email & password → validated & saved securely → confirmation response

Login: User submits credentials → verified → JWT token issued & sent securely

Token Refresh: Access tokens expire → refresh tokens validate & renew tokens without logout

Protected Routes: Middleware verifies tokens → grants/denies access accordingly

Logout: Tokens cleared from client → session invalidated on backend
